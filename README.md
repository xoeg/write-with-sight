# write-with-sight
Write with your eye sight!
Follow these steps:
1. Open `wws_get_data.py` and take loads of pictures looking at different grid points.
2. Train a convolutional neural network in `train_model.ipynb` that gets as an input the webcam images and returns the grid point you were looking at!
3. Test the model and draw or write with your eyes on a grid in `wws_write.py`.
